# FollowersTracker
It'is a small project to keep track of your Instagram's followers number. 

## How does it work?
The program asks for the username of the account that you want to track.
Then, automatically, it takes the current followers' number and store it.
Finally, it **plots** a graphic that shows you the progress of your followers' number.

## Is it possible to track multiple account?
Yes, it's. You can track **unlimited accounts**.
